Goal
- Analyze different approaches to find Nash-Equilibrium in a given m x n game size.


Based on the Nashpy package, which already implmented three kinds algorithms to find Nash Eqs.
- Nashpy:https://github.com/drvinceknight/Nashpy

Added feature function.
- Random m x n game generator or use a customized game file. 
- Computing time comparison of LH, Support Enum, and Vertex Enum. 
- Lemke-howson visualization (lemke_howson.py)
- Generate steps distribution of LH by a given size of game. 

Note:
- After installing Nashpy package, the lemke_howson.py in the Nashpy library has to be replaced by the local lemke_howson.py.
